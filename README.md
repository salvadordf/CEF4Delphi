CEF4Delphi is an open source project created by Salvador Díaz Fau to embed Chromium-based browsers in applications made with [Delphi](https://www.embarcadero.com/products/delphi/starter) or [Lazarus/FPC](https://www.lazarus-ide.org/) for Windows and Linux.

CEF4Delphi is based on DCEF3, made by Henri Gourvest. The original license of DCEF3 still applies to CEF4Delphi. Read the license terms in the first lines of any *.pas file.

CEF4Delphi uses CEF 88.1.4 which includes Chromium 88.0.4324.96.
